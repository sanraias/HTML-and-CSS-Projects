    <!-- CHALLENGE 6 COLUMNS-->

    <div class="two-columns">
        <div>
            <h4>Foundation</h4>
            <p>The club was founded in 1905 by a group of Italian immigrants in Argentina.
                It joined the Argentine Football Association League in 1913. Boca went through
                several jersey styles before settling on its distinctive blue shirt with a
                single yellow band across the chest in 1913.<br>
                <br>
                The club won the national amateur
                league championship six times before joining Argentina&apos;s newly formed national
                professional league. In 1931 Boca was the first league champion in the professional
                era, and the team has since won the league title 25 additional times.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Champions</h4>
            <p>Boca is a six-time winner of the Copa Libertadores, the top international competition
                between leading clubs from all over all South America, which began in 1960. Indeed,
                Boca is the last team to have won the Copa Libertadores without losing a single game,
                which it accomplished in 1978. In 2003 Boca beat Brazil&apos;s Santos 2&ndash;0 and 3&ndash;1
                in the home and away matches, respectively, to record the largest ever margin of victory
                (in terms of aggregate goal total) in a Copa Libertadores final. In addition,
                Boca has won the Intercontinental Cup (between the Copa Libertadores and European Cup/Champions
                League champions) three times, including noteworthy triumphs over Real Madrid in 2000 and
                AC Milan in 2003; the other victory came in 1977.</p>
